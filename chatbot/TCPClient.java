/*
    This is a simple implementation of a chat via TCP. The client connects with the server (TCPServer.java)
    that is a chatbot with 13 quotes from some movies or TV series. Inputting the correct sentence will give
    you back a quote, while any other stuff will give you back a default sentence.

    The accepted sentences are (without the surrounding ""):

    "Tell me a quote from Back To The Future"
    "Tell me a quote from Ghostbusters"
    "Tell me a quote from Harry Potter"
    "Tell me a quote from The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"
    "Tell me a quote from Star Wars"
    "Tell me a quote from V For Vendetta"
    "Tell me a quote from BoJack Horseman"
    "Tell me a quote from Friends"
    "Tell me a quote from How I Met Your Mother"
    "Tell me a quote from Rick And Morty"
    "Tell me a quote from Simpsons"
    "Tell me a quote from South Park"
    "Tell me a quote from The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air"
